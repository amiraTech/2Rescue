| **Backend (BaaS)** | **Firebase:** Cloud Firestore for the database                                  |
| **Live Data** | **WeatherAPI.com:** Forecast & Alerts API                                       |
| **Deployment & CI/CD** | **Firebase Hosting** with **GitHub Actions** for automated builds and deployments |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub                                                                    |

The application leverages **Firebase's Cloud Firestore** to provide a serverless database, allowing for real-time data submission without managing a traditional backend server. The entire frontend is deployed on **Firebase Hosting**, using a **GitHub Actions** workflow for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), automatically deploying new changes on every push to the main branch.

## üîë Key Features

* **Dynamic Weather & Alerts Page:** The alerts page is powered by the WeatherAPI.com Forecast API. It displays a 5-day weather forecast for London and shows any active national disaster alerts if they are present in the API response.

* **Dynamic Homepage Banner:** The homepage features a banner that only appears if the live API is reporting active disaster alerts, providing immediate notice of critical events.
* **Responsive UI:** Styled with pure CSS and a Flexbox-based layout for a clean and responsive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
